# Stroke Pain Studies

Welcome!  

This repository relates to two projects on stroke pain: Validation of Stroke Pain Scores from Multidomain Assessment Tools and Prevalence, Trajectory and Predictors of Post Stroke Pain. The corresponding author for both studies is Dr. Myzoon Ali from the School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow, UK, who is available at Myzoon.Ali@glasgow.ac.uk.

## [Prevalence, Trajectory, and Predictors of Poststroke Pain: Retrospective Analysis of Pooled Clinical Trial Data Set](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/STROKEAHA.123.043355)
#### BACKGROUND:
Poststroke pain remains underdiagnosed and inadequately managed. To inform the optimum time to initiate interventions, we examined prevalence, trajectory, and participant factors associated with poststroke pain.

#### METHODS:
Eligible studies from the VISTA (Virtual International Stroke Trials Archives) included an assessment of pain. Analyses of individual participant data examined demography, pain, mobility, independence, language, anxiety/depression, and vitality. Pain assessments were standardized to the European Quality of Life Scale (European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level) pain domain, describing no, moderate, or extreme pain. We described pain prevalence, associations between participant characteristics, and pain using multivariable models.

#### RESULTS:
From 94 studies (n>48,000 individual participant data) in VISTA, 10 (n=10 002 individual participant data) included a pain assessment. Median age was 70.0 years (interquartile range [59.0–77.1]), 5560 (55.6%) were male, baseline stroke severity was National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 10 (interquartile range [7–15]). Reports of extreme pain ranged between 3% and 9.5% and were highest beyond 2 years poststroke (31/328 [9.5%]); pain trajectory varied by study. Poorer independence was significantly associated with presence of moderate or extreme pain (5 weeks–3 months odds ratio [OR], 1.5 [95% CI, 1.4–1.6]; 4–6 months OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3–2.1]; >6 months OR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2–2.0]), and increased severity of pain (5 weeks–3 months: OR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1–1.2]; 4–6 months OR, 1.1 [95% CI, 1.1–1.2]; >6 months, OR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1–1.2]), after adjusting for covariates. Anxiety/depression and lower vitality were each associated with pain severity.

#### CONCLUSIONS:
Between 3% and 9.5% of participants reported extreme poststroke pain; the presence and severity of pain were independently associated with dependence at each time point. Future studies could determine whether and when interventions may reduce the prevalence and severity of poststroke pain.

##  [Validation of general pain scores from multidomain assessment tools in stroke](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2024.1328832/full)
#### Purpose: 
We describe how well general pain reported in multidomain assessment tools correlated with pain-specific assessment tools; associations between general pain, activities of daily living and independence after stroke.

#### Materials and methods: 
Analyses of individual participant data (IPD) from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA) described correlation coefficients examining (i) direct comparisons of assessments from pain-specific and multidomain assessment tools that included pain, (ii) indirect comparisons of pain assessments with the Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and (iii) whether pain identification could be enhanced by accounting for reported usual activities, self-care, mobility and anxiety/depression; factors associated with pain.

#### Results: 
European Quality of Life 3- and 5-Level (EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L), RAND 36 Item Health Survey 1.0 (SF-36) or the 0–10 Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) were available from 10/94 studies (IPD = 10,002). The 0–10 NPRS was the only available pain-specific assessment tool and was a reference for comparison with other tools. Pearson correlation coefficients between the 0–10 NPRS and (A) the EQ-5D-3L and (B) EQ5D-5 L were r = 0.572 (n = 436) and r = 0.305 (n = 1,134), respectively. mRS was better aligned with pain by EQ-5D-3L (n = 8,966; r = 0.340) than by SF-36 (n = 623; r = 0.318). BI aligned better with pain by SF-36 (n = 623; r = −0.320). Creating a composite score using the EQ-5D 3 L and 5 L comprising pain, mobility, usual-activities, self-care and anxiety/depression did not improve correlation with the 0–10 NPRS.

#### Discussion: 
The EQ-5D-3L pain domain aligned better than the EQ-5D-5L with the 0–10 NPRS and may inform general pain description where resources and assessment burden hinder use of additional, pain-specific assessments.
